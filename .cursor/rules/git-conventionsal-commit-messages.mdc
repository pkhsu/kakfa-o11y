## Scope

The scope is optional and should be a noun describing a section of the codebase:
- Examples: `auth`, `api`, `ui`, `models`, etc.
- Use `*` when the change affects more than a single scope

## Description Guidelines

- Use the imperative, present tense: "change" not "changed" nor "changes"
- Don't capitalize the first letter
- No period (.) at the end
- Keep it brief but descriptive (50 chars or less)

## Body Guidelines

- Use the imperative, present tense
- Include motivation for the change
- Contrast with previous behavior
- Should be separated from the subject by a blank line

## Footer Guidelines

- May reference issues: `Fixes #123, #456`
- May include breaking changes with `BREAKING CHANGE:` followed by description
- Breaking changes can also be indicated by adding `!` before the colon in the type/scope
- Separated from the body by a blank line
