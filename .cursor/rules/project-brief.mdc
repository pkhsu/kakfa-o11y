# Minimal Project‑Brief Rule (Small‑Team Edition)

> **Version:** 2.0.0  
> **Updated:** 2025‑05‑22  
> **Audience:** Small development teams (≤3 engineers)

Based on insights from the [r/ProductManagement – Product brief discussion](https://www.reddit.com/r/ProductManagement/comments/x7l5gk/product_briefs_what_goes_in_yours/) and keeping future growth in mind, this rule mandates only the five core sections below. Additional chapters (Architecture, Timeline, etc.) may be appended as the project matures.

## Required Sections

| # | Section H2 | Description | Key Points |
|---|-------------|-------------|-----------|
| 1 | **Background** | Problem statement | – What is the problem?<br>– Current situation / pain points |
| 2 | **Opportunity** | Why invest | – Why it’s worth investing<br>– Market / business opportunity |
| 3 | **Hypothesis & Success Criteria** | Expected outcome | – What solving it will achieve<br>– Metrics / definition of success |
| 4 | **Scope** | Boundaries | – Must‑have items<br>– Out‑of‑scope / deferred items |
| 5 | **Open Questions** | Unknowns | – Risks or questions that remain unanswered |

> **Section order is strict.** All five sections must be present; remaining content can live in an Appendix or future sections.

## Formatting

- **Language:** English (retain original technical terms where necessary).
- **Headings:** Use `##`; avoid deeper heading levels.
- **Line width:** ≤ 100 characters.
- **Indent:** 2 spaces.
- **Bullets:** `- ` (dash).
- **Tables:** Markdown pipe style.
- **Code blocks:** Triple‑back‑tick fenced; add language tag if needed.
- Each sentence ≤ 35 words; the file ends with a newline; no trailing spaces.

## Skeleton

```markdown
# Project FooBar

## Background
Describe the current pain points…

## Opportunity
Explain the market or technical advantages of investing…

## Hypothesis & Success Criteria
If we solve the problem, we expect…
- Metric 1: XXX < 100 ms  
- Metric 2: Y % user adoption

## Scope
- Must‑do: AA, BB
- Won't‑do: CC (postponed)

## Open Questions
1. Do we need multi‑region redundancy for deployment?
2. Should we adopt database X or Y?
```

## Validation Checklist

1. All five H2 headings are present and in the correct order.
2. Each section contains at least one meaningful line.
3. Line width, indentation, and trailing‑space rules are satisfied.
4. Original technical terms are retained (no incorrect translation).

*This minimal rule supersedes the previous, more extensive `project-brief.rules.mdc` requirements for teams that explicitly adopt **Small‑Team Edition**. Unless explicitly stated, use the full rule set Version 1.x.*
